## Camera Characteristics

Inside the camera, the **Focal Length** is the distance from the lens to the sensor plane (usually reported in mm)
<br/>

The **camera field of view (FOV)** is the extent of the observable world that can be seen at any give moment. FOV is typically reported in degrees and can vary greatly between lens and camera types. 
<br/>
Typically a camera with a longer focal length will have a narrower FOV and a camera with a shorter focal length will have a wider FOV. Drone cameras often have a fairly wide FOV because they are meant
to capture landscapes. 
<br/>
The graphic below shows the relationship between focal length and FOV. Highlighted is the DJI Phantom 4 multi-rotor drone.

<br/>
Digital cameras have an array of tiny photosites (corresponding to pixels) that make up the light sensitive sensor. The physical size (width and height in mm) as well as
the number of photosites can vary between sensors. 
<br/>
The graphic below shows the sensor array of the Phantom 4 camera. Multiplyng the number of photosides (pixels) wide by the number of photosites
heigh will tell you the total number of photosites for the array. In our example, the camera has 19.9 million pixels, which are also called megapixels.
