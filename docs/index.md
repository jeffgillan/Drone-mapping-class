## About
![](images/jornada_drone.png){:height=300 width=300}
<br/>
This is an introductory course on how to use small drones for aerial mapping of land and resources.

## Terminology
The term **drone** has become the most common way to refer to a remote control or autonomous aircraft. 
<br/>

There are a number of acronyms used to refer to drones.

Unmmaned Aircraft (UA)
<br/>
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
<br/>
Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)
<br/>
Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS)
<br/>
Small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS)
<br/>
Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)


## Drone Types

<br/>
Multi-rotor drones are great aircraft. Here are some characteristics: 
<br/>

+ Usually Less Expensive to Buy

+ Vertical Launch and Landing

- Shorter Flight Endurance

- Able to Map Smaller Areas

* Very Precise Flying

* Precise Control of Gimbal Angle 

<br/>

<br/>

* Relatively Expensive

* Throw Launch

* Belly Crash Landing

* Longer Flight Endurance

* Able to map very large areas

* Less Precise Flying

* Less Control of Camera Angle (via gimbal)
