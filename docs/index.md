## About
![](images/jornada_drone.png){:height=300 width=300}
<br/>
Welcome! This is an introductory course on how to use small drones for aerial mapping of land and resources. 
<br/>

            * You will learn all the skills necessary to create precisely surveyed maps using photogrammetry methods. 

            * We will cover all of the industries and applications where drone imagery maps are making big impacts on society. 

            * Additionally, students will learn how to become licensed drones pilots with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 

## Terminology
Let's start with terminology. There are a lot of different ways to refer to a remote control aircraft. I use the term **drone** most often because this has become the defacto term in society. Most people understand what you mean when you say **drone**. 
<br/>

There are a number of different acronyms used to refer to drones. Some differ depending on the industry, application, or context. But for the most part, the following acronyms are generally interchangeable. 

**Unmmaned Aircraft (UA)**
<br/>
This is an aircraft where the pilot is not onboard. It is piloted remotely, probably through radio signals. 
<br/>
<br/>
**Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)**
<br/>
This is the same thing as a **UA**
<br/>
<br/>
**Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)**
<br/>
This term refers to the entire flying system, not just the aircraft itself. Other components of the system include the remote control, the pilot, GPS, IMU, cameras, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
**Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS)**
<br/>
This is the gender neurtral term for **UAS** 
<br/>
<br/>
**Small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS)**
<br/>
This term refers to a specific weight class of UAV aircraft as designated by the FAA. To meet the definition of sUAS, aircraft need to weight less than 55 lbs on takeoff. 
<br/>
<br/>
**Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)**
<br/>
This is just another term for a drone that does not seem to get much use nowadays. 
<br/>

## Drone Types

<br/>
Multi-rotor drones are great aircraft. Here are some characteristics: 
<br/>

+ Usually Less Expensive to Buy

+ Vertical Launch and Landing

- Shorter Flight Endurance

- Able to Map Smaller Areas

* Very Precise Flying

* Precise Control of Gimbal Angle 

<br/>

<br/>

* Relatively Expensive

* Throw Launch

* Belly Crash Landing

* Longer Flight Endurance

* Able to map very large areas

* Less Precise Flying

* Less Control of Camera Angle (via gimbal)

<br/>

* All the advantages of the fixed-wing with the ability of vertical take-off and landing.
